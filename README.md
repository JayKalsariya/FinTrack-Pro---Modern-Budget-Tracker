## 🛡️ Privacy & Security Note

FinTrack Pro implements **Client-Side Data Isolation**. Unlike traditional apps that store all user data in a single global database, FinTrack Pro creates a "Vault" identified by the user's phone number. No financial data ever leaves your local storage unless you explicitly use the "Export CSV" feature.
